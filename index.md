I am a third year CS PhD in the MIT [Data Systems Group](http://dsg.csail.mit.edu/), where I am advised by [Prof. Tim Kraska](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kraska/). My research focuses on applying machine learning to database systems.

I collaborate with [Prof. Michael Mitzenmacher](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/) on learned data structures. I interned at Microsoft Research with the [DMX](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-management-exploration-and-mining-dmx/) group where I worked on learned query optimisation. Prior to MIT, I was an undergraduate at IIT Bombay where I worked with [Prof. Sudarshan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sudarsha/).
